# üßá WFFLZ NFT Minter Dapp üßá

`"WFFLZ are better than pancakes" - Bro`

An experimental project that mints WFFLZ NFTs on the Solana network. Connect your wallet and mint a WFFLZ NFT. **This is for learning purposes only** and the first of (hopefully) more Web3 experiments.

**Do not use real money/crypto to mint! Use fake SOL on devnet only!**

Thanks to [\_buildspace](buildspace.so) for providing the starter files and tutorial to create my first Dapp! Site design created by me.

### Built With:

- React
- [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) (Collection of libraries, contracts, and tools to make creating and launching NFTs easy)
- [Candy Machine](https://docs.metaplex.com/candy-machine-v2/mint-frontend) (Metaplex tool to manage a "fair mint")
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
- Solana CLI
- Node
- CSS3

### Lessons

**The most exciting parts of this project** were coming up with a frontend design and creating/minting NFTs (of course). Serious feelings of satisfaction spontaneously erupt throughout your whole body when you mint your first NFT, especially if said NFT is your own. Airdropping fake Solana to my wallet was pretty nice too üòè

**The most challenging parts of this project** were adding the logic for the Candy Machine (so much code üòµ), extensive timeouts when doing just about anything with Metaplex on the Solana blockchain, and Firefox's CORS blocking setting. Wasted an hour trying to get around CORS and ended up finishing the last half of the project with Microsoft Edge üòÆ. It wasn't as bad as you might imagine. Used a trial for QuickNode to reduce timeouts using their RPC link.

**After finishing this project I felt** excited! This was quite the challenge, but that only made finishing the project even more empowering. Though I have no idea what I just did, I definitely plan to dig into more Web3 development and its intersection with frontend development. Most importantly, I had fun. ü§¨ _all those timeout errors though._
